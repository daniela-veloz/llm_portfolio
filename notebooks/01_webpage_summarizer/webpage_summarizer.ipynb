She discovered the elements polonium and radium, contributed significantly to the treatment of cancer, and created mobile X-ray units during World War I. Her legacy continues to influence science and gender equality in the scientific community.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\nMarie Curie, born Maria Salomea Sk≈Çodowska on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, was a pioneering physicist and chemist. She moved to Paris for higher education, where she obtained degrees in physics and mathematics. Curie's research focused on radioactivity, a term she coined, leading to her seminal discovery of the radioactive elements polonium and radium alongside her husband Pierre Curie. \n\nShe made history by becoming the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields, receiving a second Nobel in Chemistry in 1911. Curie founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw, vital centers for cancer research, and played a crucial role in medical advancements during World War I by developing mobile X-ray units.\n\nDespite facing significant societal and professional challenges as a woman in science, Curie maintained her integrity, rejecting opportunities for personal gain from her discoveries. She died on July 4, 1934, from aplastic anemia, likely due to prolonged exposure to radiation without adequate safety measures. Her contributions remain influential, embedding her legacy within the fabric of modern science and inspiring future generations of scientists."

She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win it twice, and remains the only individual to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields‚ÄîPhysics and Chemistry. Curie's discoveries included the elements polonium and radium, and her research laid the groundwork for advances in medical treatment and nuclear science.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMarie Curie (1867-1934) was a notable physicist and chemist renowned for her pioneering research on radioactivity, a term she coined. Born Maria Salomea Sk≈Çodowska in Warsaw, she pursued her education in physics and mathematics at the University of Paris. Together with her husband, Pierre Curie, she discovered the radioactive elements polonium and radium. They were awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics alongside Henri Becquerel, making Curie the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize.\n\nFollowing Pierre's death in 1906, Curie became the first woman to hold a professorship at the University of Paris. She received a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her continued work with radium and polonium. During World War I, she developed mobile radiography units to assist in battlefield medical care. \n\nCurie‚Äôs dedication to science came at a personal cost, as she died of aplastic anemia likely caused by prolonged exposure to radiation. Her legacy continues with numerous institutions named in her honor, and she remains an icon for women in science, representing resilience and groundbreaking achievement."
